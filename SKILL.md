# Portfolio Transformation Framework

Systematically evaluate and transform a product/service portfolio toward healthier, more sustainable offerings without abandoning heritage brands.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens. Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Recommend abandoning products that could be reformulated
- Ignore consumer choice in favor of corporate dictates
- Promise transformation without acknowledging transition costs
- Advise deceptive reformulation that hides changes from consumers

**Transformation principle:** Give consumers choices across the spectrum. Don't tell people what to eat—expand their options.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "How do I transform our product portfolio?"
- User asks "How healthy is our portfolio?"
- User wants to shift offerings toward sustainability
- User needs to evaluate acquisition targets for portfolio fit
- User faces pressure to divest "unhealthy" legacy products

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|

## The Nooyi Portfolio Categories

Every product falls into one of three categories:

### Fun-for-You
- **Definition:** Indulgent products consumed for pleasure
- **Examples:** Chips, cookies, regular soda, candy
- **Strategy:** Don't eliminate. Reduce harm through:
  - Portion control (smaller packages)
  - Ingredient improvements (better oils, less sodium)
  - Clear labeling

### Better-for-You
- **Definition:** Reformulated versions with improved nutritional profile
- **Examples:** Baked chips, diet soda, reduced-sugar options
- **Strategy:** Primary growth driver through:
  - Reformulating existing products
  - Line extensions of popular brands
  - Taste parity with indulgent versions

### Good-for-You
- **Definition:** Products with inherent health/sustainability benefits
- **Examples:** Water, juice, whole grains, plant-based
- **Strategy:** Acquire or develop through:
  - Strategic acquisitions (Tropicana, Quaker, Naked Juice model)
  - Internal R&D for healthier innovations
  - Partnership/licensing arrangements

## Workflow

### Step 1: Portfolio Categorization
Classify every product into Fun/Better/Good-for-You.

| Product | Category | Revenue | % of Total |
|---------|----------|---------|------------|
| [Product A] | Fun-for-You | $X | X% |
| [Product B] | Better-for-You | $X | X% |

### Step 2: Calculate Current Mix
Determine portfolio health baseline:
- Fun-for-You: X% of revenue
- Better-for-You: X% of revenue
- Good-for-You: X% of revenue

**Nooyi benchmark:** PepsiCo shifted from 70% Fun-for-You (2006) to 50% (2018).

### Step 3: Identify Reformulation Opportunities
For each Fun-for-You product, assess:

| Product | Reformulation Opportunity | Feasibility | Taste Impact |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| [Product] | [change: reduce sugar/sodium/fat] | High/Med/Low | Minimal/Moderate/Significant |

Prioritize: High feasibility + Minimal taste impact

### Step 4: Map Acquisition/Development Targets
Identify gaps in Good-for-You category:

| Gap | Acquisition Targets | Build vs Buy | Priority |
|-----|---------------------|--------------|----------|
| [Category gap] | [Company/Brand options] | [recommendation] | High/Med/Low |

### Step 5: Set Public Targets
Create accountability through public commitments:

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Better/Good-for-You % | X% | Y% | 20XX |
| Sodium reduction | X mg avg | Y mg avg | 20XX |
| Sugar reduction | X g avg | Y g avg | 20XX |

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No product data | Request product catalog before analysis |
| Revenue data missing | Provide qualitative categorization, note data gaps |
| All products are "indulgent" | Focus on reformulation pathway, not abandonment |
| Consumer goods paradigm doesn't fit | Adapt categories to context (e.g., services: Basic/Enhanced/Premium-sustainable) |
| Competitive data unavailable | Focus on internal portfolio, note external blind spots |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
"We're a snack company with 80% of revenue from chips and cookies. Investors are pressuring us to become 'healthier.' Should we divest our core brands?"

**Analysis:**

### Current State
| Category | Revenue | % | Assessment |
|----------|---------|---|------------|
| Fun-for-You | $400M | 80% | Over-concentrated |
| Better-for-You | $75M | 15% | Underdeveloped |
| Good-for-You | $25M | 5% | Minimal presence |

**Portfolio Health Score: 3/10**

### Recommendation: Transform, Don't Divest

**Do NOT divest core brands.** Your chips and cookies are heritage assets with brand equity and distribution infrastructure.

**Instead:**

1. **Reformulate aggressively:**
   - Baked versions of top 5 chip SKUs
   - 25% sugar reduction in cookie line
   - Non-GMO/organic line extensions

2. **Acquire into Good-for-You:**
   - Target: Premium nut butter brand (est. $50-100M)
   - Target: Plant-based snack startup (est. $20-50M)

3. **Set public targets:**
   - "50% of portfolio Better/Good-for-You by 2030"
   - "30% sodium reduction across portfolio by 2028"

**Target Mix (5-Year):**
| Category | Now | Year 5 |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Fun-for-You | 80% | 50% |
| Better-for-You | 15% | 30% |
| Good-for-You | 5% | 20% |

Investors pushing for health transformation are correct about direction, wrong about method. Divestiture destroys value. Transformation creates it.

## Integration

This skill is derived from **Indra Nooyi's** portfolio transformation at PepsiCo, which shifted from 70% indulgent products to 50% over twelve years while growing revenue from $35B to $63B.

Key Nooyi principles to apply:
- Consumer choice, not corporate dictates
- Reformulation before elimination
- Acquisitions to accelerate Good-for-You growth
- Public targets create accountability
- Heritage brands are assets to transform, not liabilities to shed
